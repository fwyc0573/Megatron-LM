    """ Wraps arbitrary strategy and distributes the save during `save`.

    The save distribution happens without any *data* communication.
    Only the *metadata* is exchanged and based on data replication on different
    ranks, we try to distribute the save as uniformly as possible.

    This wrapper assumes, that setting `replica_id` to 0 will make the
    underlying strategy do the saving on current rank. All the other `replica_id`s
    are set to 1.

    Currently, the save distribution is realized with a greedy algorithm
    described in `distribute_chunks_to_ranks`.

        strategy (SaveShardedStrategy): base strategy to wrap
        parallelization_group (ProcessGroup, optional): process group to use for save
            distribution. Note that this doesn't have to match exactly the
            data distribution, but should cover the replication pattern
            to maximize performance. Defaults to the whole world.
        do_cache_distribution (bool, optional): whether to cache the save distribution
            from previous calls. Should be set to True only if the state dict
            structure between the calls is always the same. Defaults to True.
